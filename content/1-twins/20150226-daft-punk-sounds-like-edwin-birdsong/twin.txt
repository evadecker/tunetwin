Title: Daft Punk sounds like Edwin Birdsong

----

Text: 

Now its not a big secret that Kanye West made heavy use of Daft Punk's "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" in his 2007 release of "Stronger". The fact that the Daft Punk song was only published five years earlier and, since then, dominated charts, dance floors and personal playlists world wide, just adds to this.

So why am I telling you this?

Well, the thing is, "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" samples another tune just as well. Of course, you might say, for a band like Daft Punk, sampling is a common means of creating their music. And you are right - most of their songs contain bits and pieces of existing tunes. Yet, the extent to which the song of the French pop duo is based on another track is astonishing.

But see for yourself. Here is Edwin Birdsong's "Cola Bottle Baby" from 1979.
