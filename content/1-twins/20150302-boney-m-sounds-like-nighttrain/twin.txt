Title: Duck Sauce sounds like Boney M. sounds like Nighttrain

With their single "Barbra Streisand" ("Wooohoohoohooo hoohoohooo hoo..." - yes, that's the one), DJ duo Duck Sauce had one of 2010's most importunate hits. In case you somehow missed that - or are not sick to the death of hearing the tune, here is the video.

Its not a big surprise that veteran DJs and milkshake-buddies Armand van Helden and A-Trak are using samples to kindly remind us that singer/actress Streisand is still around. Despite the excessive use of effects though, the DJ-awesomness displayed in the respective video is put into perspective by the fact that the song essentially is a continuous loop of the intro of Boney M.'s "Gotta go Home".

The mastermind behind Boney M. and their 1979 disco hit respectively is Frank Farian, a German producer, who - among plenty of other pop bands, also put Milli Vanilli into existence. 

But it doesn't end there.

The distinct hook line of "Gotta go Home" ("Wooohoohoohooo hoohoohooo hoo..." - in case you forgot) along with the song's main elements relies on the German song "Hallo Bimmelbahn" by the band Nighttrain. The original - published in 1973, was written by brothers Heinz and JÃ¼rgen Huth, produced by none other than Frank Farian.

Deservedly, the Huth brothers were credited as co-writers of both, Boney M.'s "Gotta go Home" and "Barbra Streisand"- along with Farian. Given that the Duck Sauce track got such a lot of air play as well as license agreements for ads and computer games, the commercial benefit is huge. Nevertheless, if, and to what extend the money will actually trickle down to the original writers depends on the respective licence agreements between artists, writers, producers and labels.
