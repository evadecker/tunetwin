Title: Mario Kart sounds like Percy Faith

----

Text: 

The cheery island theme from Mario Kart's Shy Guy Beach is essentially a sped up version of Percy Faith's classic "Theme From A Summer Place". The music was written by Max Steiner, but Faith recorded the most popular version for the 1959 film *A Summer Place*. The song charted first on *Billboard* for nine consecutive weeks, setting a record for an instrumental work which has not been broken since. It was the first movie theme and the first instrumental to win a Record of the Year Grammy.

In 1976, Faith recorded a disco version of the theme titled "(link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roXCxEIsWhw text: Summer Place '76)".
