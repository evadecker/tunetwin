Title: Darth Vader's Imperial March sounds like 'Mars' from The Planets

----

Text: 

The imperial attack immediately following the open scroll of *A New Hope* uses a chord that is note-for-note identical with the coda of "Mars" from Gustav Holst's *The Planets*. Both pieces use the exact same dissonant chord: A-flat, D-flat, G from bottom to top, with a C in the bass. In Star Wars, for the last few measures Williams adds a C above the dissonant chord as well to keep the chord building in intensity.
